Untrack Yourself - basic privacy guide <a name="TOP"></a>
===================

___This post is highly inspired from ["The Social Dilemma"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mqR_e2seeM&feature=emb_imp_woyt "Social Dilemma")___

* “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.” — Arthur C. Clarke [(see)](https://lab.cccb.org/en/arthur-c-clarke-any-sufficiently-advanced-technology-is-indistinguishable-from-magic/)

* "There are only two industries that call their customers 'users': illegal drugs and software." — Edward Tufte

* "We’re training and conditioning a whole new generation of people that when we are uncomfortable or lonely or uncertain or afraid we have a digital pacifier for ourselves that is kind of atrophying our own ability to deal with that." — Tristan Harris

* "Imagine for a second, if Wikipedia said, _'We're gonna give each person a different customized definition, and we're gonna be paid by advertisers for that.'_ Then Wiki would study you, and change the entry. That's exactly what's happening on Facebook/ Youtube feed/ Google search results." — Jaron Lanier

* "Is this the last generation of people that are gonna know what it was like before this illusion took place? Like, how do you wake up from the matrix when you don't know you're in the matrix?" — Tristan Harris [(see)](https://www.jmlalonde.com/quotes-and-leadership-lessons-from-the-social-dilemma/)

* "We live in a world in which a tree is worth more, financially, dead than alive, in a world in which a whale is worth more dead than alive. For so long as our economy works in that way and cooperations go unregulated they're going to continue to destroy trees, to kill whales, to mine the earth, and to continue to pull oil out of the ground, even though we know it is destroying the planet, and we know that it's going to leave a worse world for future generations. Now we're the tree, we're the whale. Our attention can be mined. We are more profitable to a corporation if we're spending time starting at a screen, staring at an ad." — Justin Rosenstein
